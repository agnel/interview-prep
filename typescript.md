## why should we use typescript?

Using TypeScript offers several advantages over plain JavaScript, particularly for larger projects or teams. Here are some key reasons to use TypeScript:

### 1. **Static Type Checking**

- **Error Detection**: TypeScript’s static type system helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime. This includes type errors, which can prevent common bugs related to incorrect data types.
- **Improved Refactoring**: The type system makes it easier to safely refactor code by ensuring that changes are consistent across the codebase.

### 2. **Enhanced IDE Support**

- **Autocomplete**: TypeScript’s type system provides better autocomplete suggestions in IDEs and editors.
- **Intellisense**: TypeScript can offer more precise and helpful code suggestions and documentation as you code.
- **Navigation**: Improved tools for navigating codebases, such as jumping to definitions and finding references.

### 3. **Documentation and Self-Documentation**

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Type annotations serve as documentation, making it clear what types of values are expected, which can make the code more understandable for others.
- **Code Contracts**: Type definitions act as contracts that define the structure and constraints of the data being used, reducing ambiguity.

### 4. **Better Tooling**

- **Type Inference**: TypeScript can infer types even when not explicitly specified, reducing the need for verbose type annotations while still providing type safety.
- **Compiler Options**: TypeScript provides a rich set of compiler options that can be tailored to the needs of the project, including strictness settings and code transformation features.

### 5. **Modern JavaScript Features**

- **New Syntax**: TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features and can compile them down to older versions of JavaScript if needed (e.g., ES6+ features).
- **Decorators and Advanced Types**: TypeScript includes features like decorators and advanced type constructs that are not part of standard JavaScript.

### 6. **Interoperability**

- **JavaScript Libraries**: TypeScript can work seamlessly with existing JavaScript libraries. Type definitions can be added via `@types` packages, enabling better integration and type safety with third-party libraries.
- **Gradual Adoption**: TypeScript can be introduced gradually into existing JavaScript projects, allowing teams to adopt it incrementally.

### 7. **Improved Code Quality**

- **Design by Contract**: Types help define clear contracts for functions and objects, leading to better-designed APIs and fewer unexpected runtime errors.
- **Safety**: Features like strict null checks (`strictNullChecks`) help avoid common issues like null reference errors.

### 8. **Community and Ecosystem**

- **Growing Popularity**: TypeScript has gained significant adoption in the JavaScript community, leading to a large ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks that support TypeScript.
- **Framework Support**: Many modern frameworks and libraries (e.g., Angular, React, Vue) offer built-in support or strong integration with TypeScript.

### 9. **Team Collaboration**

- **Consistency**: TypeScript’s type system helps maintain consistency across codebases, making it easier for teams to work together on large projects.
- **Enforced Standards**: Teams can enforce coding standards and practices through TypeScript’s configuration and type checks.

### Example: Type Safety and Error Prevention

**JavaScript Example**:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
}

greet(42); // Runtime error: toUpperCase is not a function
```

**TypeScript Example**:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
}

greet(42); // Compile-time error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
```

In summary, TypeScript provides a robust type system that enhances code quality, improves developer experience, and aids in maintaining larger codebases. It helps catch errors early, offers better tooling and IDE support, and supports modern JavaScript features, making it a valuable tool for many development projects.

## basic types in typescript

TypeScript provides a variety of basic types that allow you to define and enforce the kinds of values that variables can hold. Here’s a rundown of the fundamental types in TypeScript:

### 1. **`number`**

- **Description**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let age: number = 30;
  let height: number = 5.9;
  ```

### 2. **`string`**

- **Description**: Represents a sequence of characters.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let name: string = 'Alice';
  let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}`;
  ```

### 3. **`boolean`**

- **Description**: Represents a value that can be either `true` or `false`.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let isActive: boolean = true;
  let hasCompleted: boolean = false;
  ```

### 4. **`void`**

- **Description**: Represents the absence of a value, typically used for functions that do not return a value.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  function logMessage(message: string): void {
    console.log(message);
  }
  ```

### 5. **`null` and `undefined`**

- **Description**:
  - **`null`**: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
  - **`undefined`**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let nothing: null = null;
  let notDefined: undefined = undefined;
  ```

### 6. **`any`**

- **Description**: Represents any type of value, effectively opting out of type checking. Use sparingly as it bypasses the benefits of TypeScript’s type system.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let randomValue: any = 5;
  randomValue = 'Hello'; // No error
  ```

### 7. **`unknown`**

- **Description**: Represents any value but requires type checking before performing operations on it. Safer than `any` because it enforces type checking.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let unknownValue: unknown = 10;
  if (typeof unknownValue === 'number') {
    console.log(unknownValue.toFixed(2)); // Safe to use as number
  }
  ```

### 8. **`never`**

- **Description**: Represents a value that never occurs. Typically used for functions that throw exceptions or have infinite loops.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
  }

  function infiniteLoop(): never {
    while (true) {}
  }
  ```

### 9. **`object`**

- **Description**: Represents any value that is not a primitive (i.e., anything that is not `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`).
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let obj: object = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
  ```

### 10. **`Array`**

- **Description**: Represents a collection of values of a specific type. Defined using `Array<type>` or `type[]`.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  let strings: Array<string> = ['apple', 'banana'];
  ```

### 11. **`Tuple`**

- **Description**: Represents an array with a fixed number of elements where each element can be of a different type.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];
  ```

### 12. **`Enum`**

- **Description**: Represents a set of named constants. Useful for defining a set of possible values.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
  }

  let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
  ```

### Example Usage of Basic Types

Here’s a combined example showing how these types might be used in a TypeScript program:

```typescript
// Using basic types
let username: string = 'Alice';
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
let userInfo: { name: string; age: number } = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

// Function with void return type
function greet(user: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${user}`);
}

// Function with never return type
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

// Array and Tuple
let scores: number[] = [90, 85, 88];
let coordinate: [number, number] = [10, 20];

// Enum
enum Status {
  Active = 'ACTIVE',
  Inactive = 'INACTIVE'
}

let currentStatus: Status = Status.Active;
```

Understanding these basic types helps you define more precise and reliable data structures in TypeScript, contributing to better code quality and fewer runtime errors.

## Explain the various settings in `tsconfig` file?

`tsconfig.json` is a configuration file for TypeScript projects. It allows you to specify compiler options, project settings, and other configurations to control how TypeScript compiles your code. Here’s a breakdown of some common and important settings you might find in a `tsconfig.json` file:

### Basic Settings

- **`compilerOptions`**: This section contains settings that control the behavior of the TypeScript compiler.
  - **`target`**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version (e.g., `ES5`, `ES6`, `ES2020`). This determines which version of JavaScript the TypeScript compiler outputs.
  - **`module`**: Defines the module system to use (e.g., `commonjs`, `amd`, `es6`, `esnext`). This affects how modules are imported and exported.
  - **`moduleResolution`**: Determines how module paths are resolved (e.g., `node`, `classic`).
  - **`outDir`**: Specifies the directory where compiled JavaScript files will be placed.
  - **`rootDir`**: Indicates the root directory of the TypeScript source files.
  - **`sourceMap`**: Generates source maps for debugging (set to `true` to enable).
  - **`declaration`**: Generates corresponding `.d.ts` files for TypeScript declaration files (useful for libraries).

### Strict Type-Checking Options

- **`strict`**: Enables all strict type-checking options. It’s a convenient way to enable strictness without specifying each option individually.
- **`noImplicitAny`**: Raises an error if any variable implicitly has an `any` type.
- **`strictNullChecks`**: Ensures that `null` and `undefined` are not assignable to other types unless explicitly allowed.
- **`strictFunctionTypes`**: Ensures function type parameters are checked more strictly.
- **`strictPropertyInitialization`**: Ensures class properties are initialized in the constructor or marked as potentially undefined.

### Module and File Resolution

- **`baseUrl`**: Sets the base directory for resolving non-relative module names.
- **`paths`**: Configures path mappings for module resolution, useful for aliasing directories.
- **`typeRoots`**: Specifies directories where type definitions are located.
- **`types`**: Includes type definitions from specific packages.

### Project Structure

- **`include`**: Specifies an array of file glob patterns to include in the compilation.
- **`exclude`**: Specifies an array of file glob patterns to exclude from the compilation.
- **`files`**: Specifies an array of individual files to include in the compilation.

### Performance and Emitting

- **`skipLibCheck`**: Skips type checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`). This can speed up the compilation process.
- **`noEmit`**: Prevents the compiler from emitting any output files. Useful for type-checking only.
- **`emitDeclarationOnly`**: Emits only `.d.ts` declaration files and skips JavaScript file output.

### Advanced Options

- **`esModuleInterop`**: Enables compatibility with `require` and `import` syntax in ES6 modules. Useful for importing CommonJS modules.
- **`allowSyntheticDefaultImports`**: Allows default imports from modules that do not have a default export.
- **`resolveJsonModule`**: Allows importing `.json` files as modules.
- **`experimentalDecorators`**: Enables support for experimental decorators, used in frameworks like Angular.
- **`emitDecoratorMetadata`**: Emits metadata for decorators, often used in conjunction with `experimentalDecorators`.

### Project References

- **`references`**: Allows setting up a project with multiple `tsconfig.json` files to enable project references and incremental builds.

### Example `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

This configuration specifies that the TypeScript code in the `src` directory should be compiled to ES6 and output to the `dist` directory, with strict type checking enabled and compatibility for ES modules and CommonJS modules.

Adjusting these settings allows you to tailor the TypeScript compilation process to fit your project’s needs and requirements.

In `tsconfig.json`, the `importHelpers`, `downlevelIteration`, and `lib` options are used to control various aspects of how TypeScript compiles your code. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

### `importHelpers`

- **Purpose**: Reduces the size of the output by reusing TypeScript’s helper functions.
- **Description**: When set to `true`, TypeScript will use helper functions from the `tslib` library (such as `__extends`, `__awaiter`, etc.) instead of generating them inline in each file. This helps to keep the emitted JavaScript files smaller and can make it easier to manage and update these helpers.
- **Usage**:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "importHelpers": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true
    }
  }
  ```
- **Requirements**: To use this option, you need to install the `tslib` package in your project. You can add it using npm or yarn:
  ```bash
  npm install tslib
  # or
  yarn add tslib
  ```

### `downlevelIteration`

- **Purpose**: Provides better support for iterables when targeting older ECMAScript versions.
- **Description**: When set to `true`, TypeScript will emit additional code to correctly handle iteration over objects that are iterable (like arrays or maps) when compiling to ECMAScript versions lower than ES6 (e.g., ES5). This ensures that `for...of` loops and other iteration constructs work correctly even in older JavaScript environments.
- **Usage**:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "downlevelIteration": true,
      "target": "es5"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Enabling this option may result in slightly larger output files due to the additional code needed to handle iteration.

### `lib`

- **Purpose**: Specifies the library files to include in the compilation.
- **Description**: This option allows you to specify a list of library files that should be included in the compilation. These libraries provide the type definitions for built-in JavaScript and TypeScript features, such as `Array`, `Promise`, and `Map`. By default, TypeScript includes a standard set of library files based on the `target` setting. You can override this default by explicitly specifying which libraries you want to include.
- **Usage**:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "lib": ["es6", "dom"]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Options**: The `lib` array can include various libraries, such as:
  - `"es5"`: ECMAScript 5 library.
  - `"es6"`: ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) library.
  - `"esnext"`: Latest ECMAScript library.
  - `"dom"`: DOM library for browser environments.
  - `"webworker"`: Library for web workers.

### Example Configuration

Here’s how you might configure these options in a `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "importHelpers": true,
    "downlevelIteration": true,
    "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

In this configuration:
- The `target` is set to `es5`, so the code is compiled down to ECMAScript 5.
- `importHelpers` is `true`, which means that TypeScript will use helper functions from the `tslib` package.
- `downlevelIteration` is `true`, ensuring that iteration constructs work correctly in ES5.
- The `lib` option includes both `es6` and `dom` libraries, so type definitions for ES6 features and DOM APIs are included.

## access modifiers in typescript

In TypeScript, access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (properties and methods). They help enforce encapsulation and manage how class members can be accessed from outside the class. TypeScript provides three primary access modifiers:

### 1. `public`

- **Description**: Members marked as `public` are accessible from anywhere. This is the default access level if no modifier is specified.
- **Usage**:
  ```typescript
  class Person {
    public name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    public greet() {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
  }

  const person = new Person('Alice');
  console.log(person.name); // Accessible
  person.greet(); // Accessible
  ```

### 2. `private`

- **Description**: Members marked as `private` are only accessible within the class they are declared in. They cannot be accessed from outside the class or even by derived classes.
- **Usage**:
  ```typescript
  class Person {
    private age: number;

    constructor(age: number) {
      this.age = age;
    }

    public getAge(): number {
      return this.age;
    }
  }

  const person = new Person(30);
  console.log(person.getAge()); // Accessible
  // console.log(person.age); // Error: Property 'age' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
  ```

### 3. `protected`

- **Description**: Members marked as `protected` are accessible within the class they are declared in and by derived (sub)classes. They are not accessible from outside the class directly.
- **Usage**:
  ```typescript
  class Animal {
    protected species: string;

    constructor(species: string) {
      this.species = species;
    }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
    public bark() {
      console.log(`Woof! I am a ${this.species}`);
    }
  }

  const dog = new Dog('Labrador');
  dog.bark(); // Accessible
  // console.log(dog.species); // Error: Property 'species' is protected and only accessible within class 'Animal' and its subclasses.
  ```

### Summary

- **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere (default).
- **`private`**: Accessible only within the class where it is declared.
- **`protected`**: Accessible within the class and by subclasses.

### Example: Combining Access Modifiers

Here's an example combining all three access modifiers:

```typescript
class Person {
  public name: string; // Public member
  private age: number; // Private member
  protected address: string; // Protected member

  constructor(name: string, age: number, address: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.address = address;
  }

  public getDetails() {
    return `${this.name}, ${this.age}, ${this.address}`;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private employeeId: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, address: string, employeeId: number) {
    super(name, age, address);
    this.employeeId = employeeId;
  }

  public getEmployeeDetails() {
    return `${this.getDetails()}, Employee ID: ${this.employeeId}`;
  }
}

const emp = new Employee('John Doe', 30, '123 Main St', 12345);
console.log(emp.name); // Accessible
console.log(emp.getDetails()); // Accessible
console.log(emp.getEmployeeDetails()); // Accessible
// console.log(emp.age); // Error: Property 'age' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
// console.log(emp.address); // Error: Property 'address' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.
// console.log(emp.employeeId); // Error: Property 'employeeId' is private and only accessible within class 'Employee'.
```

In this example:
- `name` is a `public` member, so it is accessible from anywhere.
- `age` is a `private` member, so it is only accessible within the `Person` class.
- `address` is a `protected` member, so it is accessible within the `Person` class and `Employee` subclass.
- `employeeId` is `private` within the `Employee` class.

## difference between interface and type

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` are used to define the shape of data, but they have some differences and specific use cases. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### **`interface`**

1. **Declaration**:
   - **Syntax**: `interface` uses the `interface` keyword to declare a shape.
   - **Extending**: Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the `extends` keyword.

   ```typescript
   interface Person {
     name: string;
     age: number;
   }

   interface Employee extends Person {
     employeeId: number;
   }
   ```

2. **Merging**:
   - **Declaration Merging**: Multiple `interface` declarations with the same name are automatically merged into a single interface. This is useful for extending existing types from libraries or adding additional properties.

   ```typescript
   interface Person {
     name: string;
   }

   interface Person {
     age: number;
   }

   const person: Person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }; // Merged interface
   ```

3. **Implementation**:
   - **Classes**: Interfaces can be implemented by classes. This provides a contract that the class must adhere to.

   ```typescript
   interface Greetable {
     greet(): void;
   }

   class Person implements Greetable {
     greet() {
       console.log('Hello!');
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Extensibility**:
   - **Extending**: Interfaces can extend other interfaces or multiple interfaces.

   ```typescript
   interface Address {
     city: string;
   }

   interface Person extends Address {
     name: string;
   }
   ```

### **`type`**

1. **Declaration**:
   - **Syntax**: `type` uses the `type` keyword to define a type alias.
   - **Creating Types**: Types can represent primitive types, unions, intersections, tuples, and more.

   ```typescript
   type Person = {
     name: string;
     age: number;
   };

   type Employee = Person & {
     employeeId: number;
   };
   ```

2. **Combining Types**:
   - **Union and Intersection**: Types can use union (`|`) and intersection (`&`) to combine multiple types.

   ```typescript
   type Address = {
     city: string;
   };

   type ContactInfo = Address & {
     email: string;
   };
   ```

3. **Type Aliases**:
   - **Primitive and Complex Types**: Type aliases can represent primitive types, tuples, or even complex structures.

   ```typescript
   type ID = string | number; // Union type
   type Coordinates = [number, number]; // Tuple type
   ```

4. **Conditional Types**:
   - **Conditional Logic**: Types can use conditional types for advanced type manipulation.

   ```typescript
   type IsString<T> = T extends string ? 'Yes' : 'No';
   type Test1 = IsString<string>; // 'Yes'
   type Test2 = IsString<number>; // 'No'
   ```

### Key Differences

1. **Declaration Merging**:
   - **`interface`**: Supports declaration merging (multiple declarations with the same name are merged).
   - **`type`**: Does not support declaration merging. If you try to declare the same name multiple times, it will result in a type error.

2. **Extending and Implementing**:
   - **`interface`**: Can be extended and implemented by classes.
   - **`type`**: Cannot be implemented by classes, but can use intersections and unions to create complex types.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **`interface`**: Preferred when you want to define object shapes and work with class implementations or extend existing types.
   - **`type`**: More flexible for defining various types including unions, intersections, and tuples.

### Example Comparison

**Using `interface`**:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
}

const employee: Employee = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  employeeId: 12345,
};
```

**Using `type`**:

```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = Person & {
  employeeId: number;
};

const employee: Employee = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  employeeId: 12345,
};
```

In summary, while `interface` and `type` can often be used interchangeably for defining object shapes, `interface` is generally preferred for defining class contracts and extending existing types, whereas `type` is more versatile for creating complex type expressions and unions.
